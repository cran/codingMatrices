% For users of A4 paper: The above values are suited for american 8.5x11in
% paper. If your output driver performs a conversion for A4 paper, keep
% those values. If your output driver conforms to the TeX standard (1in/1in),
% then you should add the following commands to center the text on A4 paper:
 
% \advance\hoffset by -3mm  % A4 is narrower.
% \advance\voffset by  8mm  % A4 is taller.

% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
% See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.
% See pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
% General parameters, for ALL pages:
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.9}	% max fraction of floats at top
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}	% max fraction of floats at bottom
% Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
\setcounter{topnumber}{2}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
\setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
\setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
\renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.9}	% fit big float above 2-col. text
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.07}	% allow minimal text w. figs
% Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.7}	% require fuller float pages
% N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
\renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.7}	% require fuller float pages

% remember to use [htp] or [htpb] for placement
